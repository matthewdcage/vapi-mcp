     * This is spoken to the customer before connecting them to the destination.

     * Usage:
     * - If this is not provided and transfer tool messages is not provided, default is "Transferring the call now".
     * - If set to "", nothing is spoken. This is useful when you want to silently transfer. This is especially useful when transferring between assistants in a squad. In this scenario, you likely also want to set `assistant.firstMessageMode=assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message` for the destination assistant.
     *
     * This accepts a string or a ToolMessageStart class. Latter is useful if you want to specify multiple messages for different languages through the `contents` field.
